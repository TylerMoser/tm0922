Tool Rental Application

Thank you for taking the time to review my demo.

Project overview:
* The project can be build, and the tests executed, with a simple "mvn clean install".
* The CheckoutService class is the entrypoint to the main application logic
* CheckoutServiceTest includes the 6 required test cases
* There is an exception package that includes several validation exceptions
* A tools package includes the tool object hierarchy

Additional comments:
* I would generally implement a Spring project for this type of work, with 
REST API's, dependency injection, and a service-oriented architecture. For the 
sake of keeping this demo simple to review, I have tried to keep the code 
"pure Java".
* The demo scenario seems oriented towards object-oriented development. For 
that reason, I leaned into object-oriented design for this implementation.
* Please feel free to reach out with any questions. I'd be happy to discuss.
